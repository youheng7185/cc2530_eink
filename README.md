# eink price tag, LG Innotek REBE-MZ21B

## Main components on the pcb
* CC2530F256, 8051 based mcu with zigbee (https://www.ti.com/product/CC2530) (https://www.rhydolabz.com/documents/CC2530.pdf)
* WFT0213CZ16 LW 212x104, 2.13 inch E-Ink raw display, seems like its just a generic eink display with controller (https://www.waveshare.com/2.13inch-e-paper-c.htm)

## Steps to play around with it

* SDCC 8051 compiler instead of keil or paid iar workbench,

 (https://github.com/svn2github/sdcc/blob/master/sdcc/device/include/mcs51/cc2530.h)
 
 (https://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)

* Open source CC debugger implementation, (https://github.com/Larsjep/CCLib-ESP32)

## Hook up CC2530 to esp32s3

* solder up rst, data, clock, put a 33k resistor between the dd_o and dd_i. dd_i to data, dc to clock, rst to rst

```
int CC_RST   = 4;
int CC_DC    = 6;
int CC_DD_I  = 5;
int CC_DD_O  = 7;
```

```

 * Dump flash failed, so apply the patch in the issues (https://github.com/Larsjep/CCLib-ESP32/issues/1), still dumped failed at 89 percent, I suspect its read protected

* Ignore dumping original firmware, now I can load new firmware compiled with sdcc

This is going to ERASE and REPROGRAM the chip. Are you sure? <y/N>:  y

* The mcu would run the code a bit and stop, need to exit debug mode to let it run

## Pinout

UART is using USART1 Alt. 2, SPI is using USART0 as SPI, got these value with multimeter in diode mode
| pin at package | pin function |
|---|---|
| P1_6 | UART_TX |
| P1_7 | UART_RX |
| P1_1 | EINK_RST |
| P1_2 | EINK_BUSY |
| P0_5 | EINK_CLK |
| P0_4 | EINK_CS |
| P0_3 | EINK_MOSI |
| P0_2 | EINK_DC |

## Steps to get display working

* get LLM to write init register code for uart, watchdog and spi
* To conclude up the pinout, uart is using usart1, alt 2, spi is on usart0, alt 1
* Found a exact same model eink display init code (https://github.com/kristianlm/atmega328-eink-heltec), but its weird as my display seems like a black and white only. Writing framebuffer after sending 0x13 command works, the 0x10 command don't do anything.
* The display seems like it's degraded, the contrast ratio is bad.
* Rpi pico is used as usb to uart converter, the esp32s3 is running the CCLib firmware and act as debugger without debugging features, only flashing.
